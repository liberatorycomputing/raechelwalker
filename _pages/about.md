I’m a PhD student in the Media Lab’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal's Personal Robots Group at MIT. I coined the framework “liberatory computing” to ensure that minoritized students can leverage their computing skills to challenge systemic oppression. To put this framework into practice, I founded the [Data Activism Program](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which empowers minoritized students with liberation tools and data science skills to support social justice organizations.

My research brings together data science, participatory AI, Black Critical Theory, and Critical Participatory Action Research to develop transformative computing practices. I’ve been fortunate to receive several prestigious fellowships, including the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the Amazon Robotics Fellowship, and the Graduate Education for Minorities (GEM) Fellowship. My leadership has helped my team win several grants and two Best Paper Awards at the Conference on Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT).
