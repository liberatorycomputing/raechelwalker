👋🏾 Hi, I'm Raechel Walker. I am a PhD candidate in the MIT Media Lab’s Personal Robots Group. I am advised by Dr. Cynthia Breazeal. I coined the framework **"[liberatory computing](/raechelwalker/files/liberatorycomputing.pdf)"** to ensure that minoritized youth can leverage their computing skills to challenge systemic oppression. To bring this framework to life, I founded the **[Data Activism Program](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)**, which empowers youth, social justice organizations, and data scientists with liberation tools and data science skills to advance justice-centered innovation. My research advances critical reflexivity as a unifying principle that strengthens the entire K–12-to-Workforce AI ecosystem, transforming how youth, professionals, and community organizers design and use AI.  

📃 My research brings together **📚AI education, ⚙️participatory AI, and 📢Critical Participatory Action Research** to develop transformative computing practices. 

✍🏾 Also, my work was published in peer-reviewed venues, such as the ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO), the ACM Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology Conference, and the IEEE Black Issues in Computing Education Conference.

🏆 I have won two Best Paper Awards at the Conference on Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT). Additionally, I’ve been fortunate to receive several prestigious fellowships, including the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the Amazon Robotics Fellowship, and the Graduate Education for Minorities (GEM) Fellowship. This work has been recognized with several grants by the Learning Engineering Tools Competition, the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT), and the MIT IDEAS Social Entrepreneurship Incubator.

👩🏾‍💻 I've held research roles at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Amazon Web Services' Themis Responsible AI team, Amazon Robotics, National Renewable Energy Lab, and Autodesk.
