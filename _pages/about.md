I’m a PhD student in the Media Lab’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal's Personal Robots Group at MIT.s. I coined the framework "liberatory computing" to ensure that minoritized youth can leverage their computing skills to challenge systemic oppression. To bring this framework to life, I founded the [Data Activism Program](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which empowers youth, social justice organizations, AI developers, and data scientists with liberation tools and data science skills to advance justice-centered innovation. My research advances critical reflexivity as a unifying principle that strengthens the entire K–12-to-Workforce AI ecosystem, transforming how youth, professionals, and community organizers design and use AI, and even how AI systems themselves reason.

My research brings together AI education, participatory AI, Black Critical Theory, and Critical Participatory Action Research to develop transformative computing practices. I’ve been fortunate to receive several prestigious fellowships, including the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the Amazon Robotics Fellowship, and the Graduate Education for Minorities (GEM) Fellowship. My leadership has helped my team win several grants and two Best Paper Awards at the Conference on Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT). Also, I've had the pleasure of completing internships at Amazon Web Services on the Themis Responsible AI team, Amazon Robotics, National Renewable Energy Lab, and Autodesk. 

Please contact me if you would like to discuss potential collaborations, consulting engagements, or keynote speaking opportunities.
